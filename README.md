### Overview ###

This project provides a JavaScript implementation of a growing tree algorithm for generating mazes.

It was originally ported from [growingtree.py](http://pcg.wdfiles.com/local--files/pcg-algorithm%3Amaze/growingtree.py),
a Python implementation of the algorithm, found on [this page](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:maze).

The project includes a demonstration page that allows changing the map
generation parameters, previewing the generated map, and exporting the
generated map to the Tiled Map Editor's JSON format for use in a supported game
engine ([phaser](http://phaser.io), for example).

It can also be used as a standalone JavaScript library.
